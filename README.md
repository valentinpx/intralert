# Intralert
You want to register to an Epitech module but it's full ?
This script monitors the "registered" endpoint of a module. It sends a telegram message when a seat of the module is available.

## Installation
### Telegram bot
You need to create a telegram bot and get its token. You can follow [this tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) to do so.
When your bot is created, send it a message so it can retrieve your chat id.
### Dependencies
You need to install python3 and dotenv.
```bash
pip3 install python-dotenv
```
### Configuration
You then need to create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and fill it with your intranet and telegram credentials and informations.
